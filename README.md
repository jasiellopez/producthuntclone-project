# producthuntclone-project
A simplified clone of product hunt. Used this to learn some of the basics within Django and working with databases. In the 
project, I learned how to work with static files, URLs, templates, models.


Note: I realized I kept the secret key and databases in the settings.py when I created the repo. I figured that since 
this is not an actual project that will go into production that there was not a problem with keeping them.
